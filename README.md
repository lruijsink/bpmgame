# BPM Game
Test your rhythmic skills and reaction speed with this BPM tapping game! Select a BPM and time signature and use your mouse to click to the beat.

Note: due to a lack of reliable timing in most browsers, some input compensation is performed. This may not be set accurately for your particular machine. Measured delays between clicks and beats are printed to console.log, it might be helpful to watch these values and adjust the setting "TapCompensationFactor" in src/utility/gameConfig.tsx to roughly match the average delay.

To run the application, navigate to the project directory in a console window and run `npm install`, followed by `npm start` or `npm start build`.
